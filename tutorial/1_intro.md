Before you read this guide, familiarize yourself with RPG Maker MZ and basic programming. This is not a guide to writing JavaScript, but you should be able to follow along if you have some basic coding knowledge.

## Getting Started

1. Download a code editor. I recommend [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Create a new RPG Maker project called Tester. Navigate to the root folder.
3. Go to /js/plugins and create a shortcut to the folder.


I would also recommend either the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) extension so that you can test your game without having to open RPG Maker. More information in the Testing & Debugging section.
